TVC - Toy Version Control

TVC is a really terrible remake of git in Ruby.  It should never really be used; its creation was a joke and a learning experience.  It will always be inferior to git.  I read a blog post called The Git Parable (http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html), and wrote it based on some of the explanations given there.  It's not a terribly well written piece of code, just a script I hacked together in the span of about a day.

However, you might find it interesting to look at.  It works in limited situations: if you only want a local repository, and you don't need merging, well, it might do.  TVC currently has the following features:
- Storing versions
- Branching (No merging!)
- Viewing commit history for the branch you're on
- Pulling a previous revision
