TVC - Terrible Version Control

TVC is a really terrible pseudo-remake of git in Ruby.  It should never really be used; its creation was a joke and a learning experience.  It will always be inferior to git.  I read a blog post called The Git Parable (http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html), and wrote it based on some of the explanations given there.  It's not a terribly well written piece of code, just a script I hacked together in the span of about a day.  I'm slowly adding to and revising it, but don't expect much.  If you're the version control police, please don't arrest me.  It was all meant as good fun, I swear!

Also, this is the first real thing I've written in Ruby.  It's not going to be pretty, and I'm pretty sure I'm not doing things "the Ruby way" or whatever.  Be gentle.

However, you might find it interesting to look at.  It works in limited situations: if you only want a local repository, and you don't need a whole lot of features or quality, well, it might do.  

TVC currently has the following features:
- Storing versions
- Branching
- Merging (but it's a pretty terrible merge right now, don't trust it!)
- Viewing a list of commits for the branch you're on
- Pulling a previous revision

This script needs the following installed:
- Ruby (I made it using 1.9.2, but I don't think there's anything really specific to 1.9 in there)
- json gem (gem install json)
- diff-lcs gem (gem install diff-lcs)

Things I might do in the future:
- Compression.  The stored files currently will take up a large amount of space, they'll need to be compressed.
- Viewable diffs and statuses.
- Figure out repository recursively (right now you have to be in the root of the repository to do anything)
- Make this into some sort of distributable form (but let's be honest, Ruby is kind of crap for this)
- Unit tests.  Probably should have started with those, but oh well.
